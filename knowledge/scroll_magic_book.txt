'Scroll Blockchain: A Layer 2 Scaling Solution for Ethereum
Abstract
Scroll is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup technology to address Ethereum’s scalability challenges while maintaining security and decentralization. By utilizing a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), Scroll ensures compatibility with Ethereum’s ecosystem, enabling seamless migration of decentralized applications (dApps). This article explores Scroll’s purpose, technical architecture, security mechanisms, and its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), including potential relevance to vault contracts like MorphoMarketV1Adapter. It also outlines the research purpose and objectives for studying Scroll in the context of blockchain scalability and security.
1. Introduction
Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications, faces scalability limitations, including high gas fees and network congestion, particularly during periods of high demand (e.g., the 2020 DeFi Summer). Scroll, launched in October 2023, is a zkEVM-based L2 solution designed to enhance Ethereum’s throughput, reduce transaction costs, and preserve its security and decentralization. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), Scroll processes transactions off-chain while ensuring their validity through cryptographic proofs verified on Ethereum’s Layer 1 (L1). This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Scroll’s technical principles, architecture, and applications, with a focus on its relevance to DeFi and smart contract security.
1.1 Purpose of Research
The purpose of this study is to investigate Scroll’s role as a scalable, secure, and developer-friendly L2 solution for Ethereum, particularly in the context of DeFi applications and vault management systems. Given the increasing prevalence of vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols (e.g., unauthorized access in vault contracts), this research seeks to evaluate Scroll’s potential to enhance the security and efficiency of Ethereum-based dApps.
1.2 Objectives

To analyze Scroll’s zkEVM architecture and its compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts.
To evaluate the security mechanisms of Scroll’s ZK rollup, including its reliance on Ethereum’s L1 security.
To assess Scroll’s applicability to DeFi vault contracts, such as those using ERC-4626 standards.
To identify potential vulnerabilities and propose mitigations for deploying secure dApps on Scroll.

2. Background
2.1 Ethereum’s Scalability Challenges
Ethereum’s monolithic design prioritizes decentralization and security but struggles with scalability, leading to high gas fees (e.g., exceeding 500 gwei during peak periods) and slow transaction finality. Layer 2 solutions, such as rollups, address these issues by processing transactions off-chain and submitting compressed data or proofs to L1. ZK rollups, like Scroll, use zero-knowledge proofs to ensure transaction validity, offering faster finality and enhanced privacy compared to optimistic rollups.
2.2 Scroll Overview
Founded in 2021, Scroll is a zkEVM-based L2 solution that launched its mainnet in October 2023. It aims to scale Ethereum while maintaining EVM compatibility, allowing developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts with minimal modifications. Scroll’s SCR token, introduced in October 2024, supports transaction fees, governance, and staking, fostering a decentralized ecosystem. As of 2025, Scroll ranks as the third-largest Ethereum L2 by total value locked (TVL), with $748 million, and the largest zkEVM by market share.
3. Technical Principles and Architecture
Scroll’s design is guided by principles of security, EVM compatibility, decentralization, and efficiency, making it a robust platform for DeFi and other applications.
3.1 Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK Rollup)
Scroll employs ZK rollups to bundle transactions off-chain, generating a succinct ZK proof that verifies their correctness. This proof, along with compressed transaction data, is submitted to Ethereum L1, reducing computational load and gas costs. The zkEVM ensures that Scroll executes Ethereum smart contracts natively, supporting bytecode-level compatibility. This allows dApps, such as Uniswap or Aave, to operate on Scroll without code changes.
3.2 Architecture Components
Scroll’s architecture consists of:

Sequencer Node: A centralized node (with plans for decentralization) that orders transactions, creates L2 blocks, and submits proofs to Ethereum L1. The sequencer ensures fast pre-confirmation on L2.
Roller Network: A decentralized network of provers generating ZK proofs for L2 blocks. Scroll’s proving infrastructure is parallelizable, allowing scalability by adding more nodes. The team is developing GPU-based provers and exploring ASIC/FPGA solutions.
Bridge and Rollup Contracts: Deployed on Ethereum L1, these contracts facilitate asset transfers between L1 and L2 and verify ZK proofs. The Bridge Contract enables users to send tokens or messages, while the Rollup Contract ensures data availability and transaction validity.
Scroll Nodes: Include the Sequencer, Coordinator, and Relayer, enabling user interaction with the L2 network.

3.3 Security Mechanisms
Scroll inherits Ethereum’s L1 security through ZK proofs verified by smart contracts on L1. This ensures users do not rely on L2 node honesty, minimizing trust assumptions. Scroll’s open-source codebase and $1M bug bounty program (launched in 2023) enhance security through community audits and continuous testing. The Scroll Canvas system, using Ethereum Attestation Service, provides non-transferable badges to incentivize user engagement and establish a reputation system.
4. Applications in DeFi
Scroll’s EVM compatibility and low-cost transactions make it ideal for DeFi applications, including:

Vaults and Lending: Protocols like Aave and Morpho Blue can deploy on Scroll, leveraging its scalability. For example, a vault contract like MorphoMarketV1Adapter could use Scroll to reduce gas costs for allocate and deallocate operations, improving efficiency for users and curators.
Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Scroll supports DEXs like Uniswap, enabling faster token swaps with lower fees.
NFTs and Gaming: Scroll’s fast transaction processing (approximately 10 seconds block time) supports NFT minting and gaming dApps, reducing costs for users.

4.1 Relevance to MorphoMarketV1Adapter
The MorphoMarketV1Adapter contract, which integrates with Morpho Blue and an ERC-4626 vault, could benefit from deployment on Scroll. Key advantages include:

Reduced Gas Costs: Scroll’s ZK rollup lowers fees for operations like skim or setIsAllocator, making vault management more affordable.
Timelock Security: The timelocked() modifier in setIsAllocator aligns with Scroll’s focus on security. Deploying on Scroll ensures that timelock proposals are verified on L1, preventing unauthorized access.
Curator Role: Scroll’s decentralized governance could allow curators to propose market parameters (e.g., MarketParams) via community-driven processes, enhancing transparency compared to centralized curator roles in Morpho Blue.

5. Security Considerations
While Scroll’s ZK rollup provides robust security, potential vulnerabilities include:

Sequencer Centralization: The current centralized sequencer could be a single point of failure. Scroll plans to decentralize this component to mitigate risks.
Smart Contract Risks: Bugs in Scroll’s L1 contracts (e.g., Bridge or Rollup Contract) could affect fund security. The bug bounty program and open-source development help address this.
Integration with DeFi: Deploying contracts like MorphoMarketV1Adapter on Scroll requires auditing for compatibility with zkEVM and validating MarketParams to prevent misconfigurations.

5.1 Mitigations

Decentralize Sequencer: Transition to a permissionless sequencer network to reduce centralization risks.
Audit Contracts: Conduct thorough audits of Scroll-specific deployments, especially for critical functions like skim or allocate.
Validate Parameters: Implement checks for MarketParams in contracts to ensure curator-provided data is secure, as discussed in your prior questions.

6. Research Implications
Scroll’s zkEVM and ZK rollup technology offer a promising framework for scaling Ethereum-based DeFi applications. For researchers studying vault security (e.g., MorphoMarketV1Adapter), Scroll provides a platform to test low-cost, secure transaction processing. The objectives outlined earlier can guide future studies:

Objective 1: Analyzing zkEVM compatibility ensures contracts like MorphoMarketV1Adapter function correctly on Scroll.
Objective 2: Evaluating ZK proof verification confirms Scroll’s security for vault operations.
Objective 3: Testing DeFi vaults on Scroll’s Sepolia testnet can validate cost savings and performance.
Objective 4: Proposing mitigations, such as parameter validation or timelock enhancements, strengthens Scroll-based deployments.

7. Conclusion
Scroll is a leading Ethereum L2 solution that addresses scalability through ZK rollups while maintaining EVM compatibility and security. Its architecture, including the sequencer, roller network, and L1 contracts, supports efficient transaction processing and developer-friendly dApp deployment. For DeFi applications like MorphoMarketV1Adapter, Scroll offers reduced costs and enhanced security, aligning with the needs of curators and vault managers. Future research should focus on auditing Scroll-specific deployments and exploring decentralized governance to further enhance its ecosystem.
